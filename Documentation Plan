Introduction
Project Name:
Upstage Documentation
Scope and Objectives
User instructions
User interface overview
Style guide

Publishing Details (formats, ways of delivery to end users)
We will publish on GitHub and Floss manuals. We will use booktype to publish on user facing documentation on Floss manuals. We will use Python to do so.

Detailed Content Plan
c. Detail color and font usage. Ideally reflects UI. Turtle green accents. Otherwise black and white. Grey body font color. Sans serrif font.
For specific elements: Fuscia and yellow orange would create a triad with turtle green. Consult with Elise.

Data Management
Will use in-house style guide, largely based on UK Microsoft Manual of Style. Where in-house guide does not specify a preference, consult with UK Microsoft Manual of Style.
Time Estimates
Ongoing through 2021
Style guide must be written first. It is only two pages, so it should not take longer than a month to complete, at most.
Deliverable a. and b. can be written simultaneously.
Responsible Persons
Claudia Beezhold - Role: Technical Writer
Scope of work: Claudia will report to Elise on the interface overview and consult with on style guide.
Elise: Graphic design and UI developer


Workflow
