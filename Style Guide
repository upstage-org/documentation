Upstage Style Guide
Goals
Our goals are clarity, accessibility, 
concision, and consistency. 
To achieve these goals, we follow the principles of the Plain English movement. 
We also like to be a little different here at Upstage--as a company based in New Zealand, we use standard New Zealand English (NZE). 
If we do not specify a preference on a certain point, defer to NZE or British English (BrE) standards. 
We will update this style guide regularly to reflect our voice and brand, as well as to refine and expand our specifications.

Upstage is a platform for artists, so our voice is ____.
